## Lab 2


## Question 1

The image is tif, it has 4 channels, with code image=img(:,:,1:3) the image is ready to save as JPG.

## Question 2 
We apply the grey level to image in oreder to obtain negative image as showen in the code.


## Question 3 

Image negatives useful for enhancing white or grey detail embedded in dark regions of an image.
we got the same histogram but it's symmetric to Y axis.

This is the histogram for the original image :

This is the histogram for the negative of the original image :

if you mean you want to compare the two histograms for binarized image and original image this is the histogram for binarized image and it's  2 binz for white and black.

## Question 4 

The histogram equalization is use to enhance contrast of the image. 
this the result.

## Question 5 
As I notice from studying the Binarized for image it's useful when the shape in the image is too dark and not clear after applying the imbinarize on the image we got the image with clear shape. 
Also, to detect the letters from images after applying the thresholding.
